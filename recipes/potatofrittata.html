    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Frittata is a simple Italian Egg based dish, similar to Omelette or crustless quiche. It is incredibly versatile, satisfying and can be enjoyed at any time of the day. It is really easy to make, well, depending on the fillings you choose to go with. Frittata can be made simple by using just Eggs and Peppers and it would still taste absolutely
    delicious.</p>
    <p>I'm choosing to make mine really satisfying by incorporating Potatoes, Bacon and Frankfurters. Feel free to leave them out if you like. You really don't need to use same ingredients as stated, simply make it your own recipe by throwing in whatever suits you.
