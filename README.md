 Working On My First Odin Project

I'm excited to be working on my very first project from The Odin Project course

This project is an opportunity to put into practice everything I've learned so far — from installing an operating system to learning about the command line basics, understanding Git basics, and writing HTML codes.

 Project Goal

The goal is to build a simple recipe website using HTML, while actively practicing what I learned during the Git lesson and the terminal to carryout the project.

This project marks the beginning of my journey into frontend development, and I’m really looking forward to seeing how far I can go from here.
